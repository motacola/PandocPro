## Project overview
PandocPro (docx-md-sync) is a macOS-focused toolkit that keeps Word `.docx` files and Markdown sources in sync. It wraps Pandoc conversions behind Bash scripts plus a friendly `dsync` menu, automatic backups, watch mode, UI helpers, and optional MCP/AI integrations. The repo mixes shell scripts, small Node utilities (watcher, HTTP UI server), and GUI/website folders. Core workflow: drop `.docx` files inside `docs/`, run the interactive menu to clone/export/sync, and optionally use watch mode or GUI dashboards for live editing. Additional assets live in `site/`, `gui/`, `ui-server/`, and `templates/` while `backups/` stores safety copies.
