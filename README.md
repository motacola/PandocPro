# Word ↔ Markdown Sync 🚀

PandocPro lets anyone work on Word documents without living inside Word. Drop a `.docx` file in the project, press `dsync`, and follow the friendly menu—no coding knowledge required.

## 👋 What You’ll Need (macOS)

- **Homebrew** – easiest way to install the tools below: [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
- **Pandoc** – handles the Word ↔ Markdown conversions: `brew install pandoc`
- **Node.js 18+** – powers the “live update” feature: `brew install node`
- **Microsoft Word** – for final polish and sharing
- **Visual Studio Code** – comfortable place to edit: `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`
- *(Optional)* **Claude Desktop (Desktop Commander)** – lets AI run the workflow for you
- *(Optional)* **docSync MCP config** – see [MCP-INTEGRATION.md](MCP-INTEGRATION.md) for a copy‑paste YAML snippet

> **Tip:** After cloning the repo, run `npm install` once so watch mode works later.

## ⚡ Get Going in Minutes

1. **Clone the project**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/motacola/PandocPro.git
   cd PandocPro
   ```

2. **Run the guided setup (recommended)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
   This checks for Homebrew, Pandoc, Node.js, runs `npm install`, offers to add the `dsync` alias, and can even drop a Desktop launcher—no manual editing required.

   Prefer manual steps?
   ```bash
   npm install
   ./scripts/setup-alias.sh
   source ~/.zshrc  # or open a new terminal window
   ```

3. **Add your documents**
   - Copy `.docx` files into `docs/` (subfolders are fine).
   - The first time, run `dsync` option 1 to create the Markdown twin automatically.

4. **Use the interactive menu**
   ```bash
   dsync
   ```
   Pick a document, choose **Convert → Markdown**, **Export → Word**, **Auto Sync**, **Watch Mode**, etc. The menu explains each action in plain English.

   *(Prefer double-clicking? Run `./scripts/create-launcher.sh`—or say “yes” during `setup.sh`—to place a `Word-Markdown-Sync.command` launcher on your Desktop.)*

5. *(Optional)* **Wire up AI helpers**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/configure-llm.sh
   ```
   The helper detects Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp installs or lets you point to any custom HTTP endpoint, then saves the selection for use in MCP workflows.

That’s enough to edit Word docs in VS Code without touching advanced commands. Come back to the menu whenever you need another conversion.

## 📖 Usage

### Interactive Menu (Recommended)

```bash
dsync
```

The menu lists your Word files and explains each action in plain English. Pick what you need and it does the rest.

### VS Code Integration

Open the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`) → "Tasks: Run Task" → Choose:
- **DOCX → MD** – Make a Markdown copy of the selected Word file
- **MD → DOCX** – Build a fresh Word document from your Markdown edits
- **Sync (auto)** – Let the script choose the newer file and copy that over

### Watch Mode

Start watch mode for live updates:
```bash
dsync
# Select document
# Choose "Live update while I edit"
```

Now every time you press ⌘S in VS Code, the matching Word document refreshes automatically. ✨

---

## 🎯 Typical Workflow

1. Drop your Word doc in `docs/`
2. Run `dsync`
3. Choose “Make a Markdown copy” (option 1)
4. Edit the `.md` file in VS Code (extensions welcome!)
5. Optional: ask the AI helper to tidy things up
6. Choose “Create a Word file from my Markdown” (option 2)
7. Open the refreshed `.docx` in Word for final formatting

---

## 🤖 Automation with Desktop Commander

Ask me (Claude) to help you:

**Examples:**
- "Convert my report to markdown"
- "Improve the bullet points and export to Word"
- "Summarize the presentation and create talking points"
- "Fix spelling and grammar, then export"

I can read, edit, and convert your documents automatically!

---

## 🤖 MCP Automation Setup (Optional)

Want to drive everything through Claude Desktop? Set up the `docSync` MCP once:

1. Install **Claude Desktop for macOS** and enable **Desktop Commander** in the app preferences.
2. Create `~/mcp/tools/docsync.yaml` and paste the configuration from [MCP-INTEGRATION.md](MCP-INTEGRATION.md) (the YAML registers every `docSync.*` tool shown above).
3. Restart Claude Desktop so it discovers the new MCP tool suite.

After that you can ask Claude things like “Convert report.docx to markdown”, “Improve presentation.md and export to Word”, or “Start watch mode for notes.md” and it will invoke the right commands automatically.

---

## 🧠 Configure Your Local LLM (Optional)

Prefer running your own models? Use the helper to discover what's on your Mac:

```bash
./scripts/configure-llm.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect installs such as **Ollama**, **LM Studio**, or **llama.cpp**
- Let you register any custom HTTP endpoint
- Save your choice to `config/llm-selection.json` for reuse
- *(Optional)* Install `jq` (`brew install jq`) for a pretty summary after the script runs

Reference that JSON file when wiring up MCP configs, VS Code extensions, or other automations so they call the model you prefer.

## 🖥️ Desktop GUI (Preview)

Prefer windows and buttons over terminals? A new Electron-based GUI is bundled in `gui/` and already knows how to list your docs, trigger conversions, edit Markdown visually, and show live logs/history.

```bash
npm run gui:dev    # start the Electron + Vite app in dev mode
# In the Electron window:
# 1. Pick a .docx from the dropdown
# 2. Use the TipTap editor to rewrite Markdown with WYSIWYG controls, save, or “Save & Export”
# 3. Choose an action (Convert, Export, Auto Sync) and click “Run Selected Action”
# 4. Watch stdout/stderr per-run logs, copy them if needed, and review Recent Activity pulled from logs/history.log
```

When you’re ready to distribute the desktop app, build installers with:

```bash
npm run gui:build  # produces DMG + ZIP bundles in gui/release/
```

The GUI now ships with a TipTap-based editor, watch controls are on deck, and onboarding wizards are planned so non-technical teammates never have to see raw Markdown or the terminal.
