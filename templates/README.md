## Templates

- `reference.docx` (optional): Custom Word theme (headers, fonts, spacing). Set `DOCSYNC_REFERENCE_DOC` to point here. A minimal starter is included.
- `reference.pptx` (optional): Custom slide master for PPTX exports. Set `DOCSYNC_REFERENCE_PPTX` or drop your template at `templates/reference.pptx` and the converter will pick it up automatically. A minimal starter is included.
- `pdf.css` and `html.css`: Default styles used for PDF/HTML exports; feel free to tweak them.

If you replace a template, rerun your export so the new style is applied. Keep backups of your custom templates in version control if you want teammates to share the same look.
